# 🌾 Crop Yield Prediction & Dashboard

This project is a complete solution for predicting agricultural crop yields using Machine Learning and a web-based dashboard.

## 🚀 Project Overview
* **Machine Learning:** A predictive model built with XGBoost that achieves a **93.87% accuracy ($R^2$ Score)**.
* **Dashboard:** An interactive HTML dashboard for visualizing crop data and predictions.
* **Key Finding:** Horticultural crops show higher yield variance than standard grains in the Tamil Nadu region.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Data Science:** Python, XGBoost, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn.
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Dashboard).
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `index.html`: The main dashboard file.
- `Crop_Yield_Prediction_ML.ipynb`: The machine learning analysis and model.
- `/data`: Contains the datasets (CSV files) used for training.

## 📊 Model Performance
- **$R^2$ Score:** 0.9387 (93.87%)
- **RMSE:** 0.68
- **Validation:** Statistically validated with P-value < 0.001.

## ⚙️ How to Run
1. View the dashboard by opening `index.html` in your browser.
2. Run the `Crop_Yield_Prediction_ML.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab to see the model training process.
